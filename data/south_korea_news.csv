Hana Financial rolls out housing pensions products for older adults,"Tue, 27 May 2025 13:07:03 GMT",Korea Times News,"Hana Financial Group has launched a new housing pension product that allows owners of multiple high-value properties to qualify for enrollment, the lender announced Tuesday. Otherwise known as a reverse mortgage, this financial product allows homeowners to borrow against their home’s equity and receive monthly lifetime payouts. It helps older adults supplement their reduced income after retirement, but it results in a smaller inheritance for their children. The product was developed jointly by Hana Bank and Hana Life. It is available to people aged 55 and older. It is a nonrecourse product, meaning the heirs do not inherit debt even if the subscribers die and their home sells for lower than the loan balance. The lender bears the difference between the original price and the market price. If the home sells for higher than the loan balance, the heirs are able to inherit the difference. Hana said the product will be available at a fixed rate of 3.95 percent for long-term security.

By aligning himself with Park’s legacy of state-led development and industrialization, Lee is signaling a strategic shift toward the political center. This move suggests recognition that ideological purity has diminishing utility amid mounting economic anxieties. It also underscores the enduring resonance of Park’s mythos in the Korean political imagination, particularly among older and centrist voters who associate him with modernization, if not democratization. Lee’s pivot to moderation is evident throughout his evolving economic platform. The once-central promise of a universal basic income — a hallmark of his 2022 presidential campaign — has quietly faded into the background.

Chagall's color-drenched dreamscape returns to Korea in blockbuster show,"Tue, 27 May 2025 13:07:03 GMT",Korea Times News,"“I paint, perhaps, because it takes the place of the words I lack,” wrote Marc Chagall (1887-1985) in 1957, in a letter to French critic Jean Paulhan — a quiet revelation from one of the titans of modern art. The Russian-born French artist’s signature sense of childlike fantasy, rendered in a palette of ripe, saturated colors, has cast its spell across borders for a century. His romantic vista unfurls like a reverie half-remembered: a blotchy medley of embracing couples, blooming bouquets, donkeys, roosters, fiddlers, winged apparitions, fish, mermaids, nymphs, as well as recurring echoes of folklore and Jewish symbolism. Suspended in a gravity-free dreamscape, these motifs rarely appear in their natural hues. Instead, they coalesce in an organically surreal rhythm — artificial in tone, yet inexplicably harmonious. “When Matisse dies,” Picasso once said, “Chagall will be the only painter left who understands what color really is.” Korea has been no exception in its enduring fascination with the modern master, as evidenced by the number of retrospectives and exhibitions h",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/lifestyle/arts-theater/20250527/marc-chagalls-color-drenched-dreamscape-returns-to-korea-in-blockbuster-show?utm_source=rss,South Korea

Does anybody care?,"Tue, 27 May 2025 13:07:03 GMT",Korea Times News,"You’d think that as artificial intelligence becomes more advanced, governments would be more interested in making it safer. The opposite seems to be the case. Not long after taking office, the Trump administration scrapped an executive order that pushed tech companies to safety test their AI models, and it also hollowed out a regulatory body that did that testing. The state of California in September 2024 spiked a bill forcing more scrutiny on sophisticated AI models, and the global AI Safety Summit started by the U.K. in 2023 became the “AI Action Summit” earlier this year, seemingly driven by a fear of falling behind on AI. None of this would be so worrying if it weren’t for the fact that AI is showing some bright red flags: behavior described by researchers as self-preserving and deceptive.
